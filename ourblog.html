            <h1>MI Captaincy Saga: A Curious Case of IPL’s Most Valuable Franchise</h1>
            <p>MI Captaincy Saga: A Curious Case of IPL’s Most Valuable Franchise Since the inception of the IPL (Indian
                Premier League) in 2008, we have seen a plethora of controversies revolving around individual players
                and franchises as well. However, the talk of the town of the IPL 2024 season is all about MI captaincy.
                Some say…</p>

            <h1>India vs Sri Lanka: 3 standout points from first ODI</h1>
            <p>In the end, it was a tie. India had the game under control via a 57-run sixth wicket partnership between
                KL Rahul and Axar Patel. Then, the Sri Lankan spinners struck again. Shivam Dube (25, 24 balls) played a
                good hand to take the tourists on the cusp of victory. But two wickets in two balls put paid to their
                hopes. India would be disappointed, but there are two more ODIs still to be played in the ongoing
                series. Here are the three things that we learned from the first game in Colombo on Friday…</p>

            <h1>KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant – tough call for Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir</h1>
            <p>KL Rahul went first into one of the nets. Rishabh Pant went later. As India trained at the Premadasa
                Stadium on the eve of their ODI series opener against Sri Lanka, the focus was on the two players who
                might be competing with each other for the wicketkeeper-batsman’s slot.</p>

            <h1>Women’s Asia Cup 2024 – The Chamari Athapaththu show that defined her legacy</h1>
            <p>“When Chamari Athapaththu walks out to bat, better to switch on the TV.” This particular line has echoed
                in the mind ever since yours truly ended up watching the left-hand batter crunch a game-changing 72-ball
                62 in the England-Sri Lanka encounter during the 2013 50-over World Cup. More than a decade after that
                momentous victory over one of the powerhouses of women’s cricket, Chamari was all geared up to lay the
                foundation for Sri Lanka’s maiden Asia Cup title. And up against Sri Lanka was one more formidable
                opponent, India, who in turn were the favourites to lift the title.</p>

            <h1>Gambhir’s winning mentality could be the key to successful transition</h1>
            <p>Many moons ago, when Gautam Gambhir was an active international player, this correspondent had an
                interaction with him. He was dropped from the Indian team and demoted to Grade B in the list of the
                BCCI’s centrally-contracted players.</p>
